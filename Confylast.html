        I have no idea how to frickin start saying the things I want to say.<br>
        I am at a complete loss of words to tell you how I feel. However, if you <br>
        are doubting what you have seen. I want to reassure you that all of it is true. <br>
        I like you. I really do.

        I admire you. The way you compose and present yourself. Your little twist and turns.<br>
        The puzzling words you muttered throughout time. Your intelligence which I don't think I've<br> 
        seen from anyone before. The wisdom you posses that I cannot wrap my head around.

        To think that what I've seen from you might only be the surface, I'd scratch deeper than Challenger<br> 
        Deep. But I did not, and I don't know if I could. Frankly, I'm not even sure if you'd allow it.

        I must say, you are quite the intriguing type of person. The first time I noticed you, you had long<br> 
        hair. Shoulder length if I remember correctly. It was one of the days during our online class and I<br>
        thought to myself, "Heh. Ang cute ah." And so the world kept spinning. Eventually I forgot about it.<br><br>
        Until the first day of tenth grade came. I have never seen so many tall people put together in one room.<br>
        And yet it was your eyes. Your cold gazing eyes. Boi ang sungit ng mga mata mo. Very captivating eyes.

        One of the things I admire about you. The next thing I knew, I fell head over heels because you were<br> 
        being a nerd. I know that people who are smart at technology aren't all nerds but you are. Tech nerd.<br> 
        The next thing I knew, you weren't only a tech nerd, you are also a book nerd. A FRICKIN LOTR NERD. I got<br> 
        overwhelmed when you started asking me questions about Silmarillion. Oh boy. If I'm not mistaken, I think<br>
        you're also an air nerd. Sorta. I don't know if you remember this, but it was during p.e. you started rotating<br>
        your whole arms, I started rotating mine. You told me which direction to rotate it, and you called it something.<br> 
        I don't remember what it was, but I thought to myself, "Hey, this dude knows a lot of things."<br>

        From then on I knew I liked you. And I still do. However I am ruled over by cowardice. Denial was the way to go.<br> 
        Projecting your traits onto other people was my move. Why couldn't I have just spoken to you? I don't know dude.<br> 
        To tell you the truth, I was going to confess to you on the night of prom. But you know how it went. In the process<br> 
        of processing my own feelings, I did what I always do. Take the route of stupidity and project.

        I've since learned to be better and to be a bit more courageous. So here I am. I am telling you, I like you.<br>
        I really do. You are like a book in a library. If before, I would pick up the book, go to the back and read<br>
        the blurb, get  intrigued but hesitate. I won't now. I will wholeheartedly pick up that book, read every word<br> 
        from front to back and cherish everything it has to offer. Everything I see and feel about it. However, if it<br> 
        isn't what the book would allow, I wholeheartedly understand. I will still cherish the bits and pieces it allowed<br> 
        me to have, even if it was just a few moments.
